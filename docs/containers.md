title: Containers
---

In our application, view is separated into two different entities. One is called components and another is container. Because components are much easier to reuse.

My container components:

- Are concerned with how things work.
- May contain both presentational and container components** inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles.
- Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
- Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components.
- Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
- Are usually generated using higher order components such as connect() from React Redux, createContainer() from Relay, or Container.create() from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand.
- Examples: UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList.
I put them in different folders to make this distinction clear.

## Benefits of This Approach

- Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way.
- Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.
- Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page.
- This forces you to extract “layout components” such as Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu and use this.props.children instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components.

## Example

// CommentListContainer.js

```js
import React from "react";
import CommentList from "./CommentList";

class CommentListContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { comments: [] };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("/my-comments.json")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(comments => this.setState({ comments }));
  }

  render() {
    return <CommentList comments={this.state.comments} />;
  }
}
```

// CommentList.js

```js
import React from "react";

const Commentlist = comments => (
  <ul>
    {comments.map(({ body, author }) => (
      <li>
        {body}-{author}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```
